Evolving Robocode - Team DarkSouls
===============================
v0.1

This project is a class assignment to develop a robot for the [Robocode] (http://robocode.sourceforge.net/ "Link") programming game that relies at least partially on evolved code.

Note that this project is built from a codebase that includes implementations of many of the algorithms in [Sean Luke's book Essentials of Metaheuristics]([http://www.lulu.com/shop/sean-luke/essentials-of-metaheuristics/paperback/product-15028803.html "Link to the book on Lulu.com")
